# Insurance-Cost-prediction-Model
This project builds a machine learning model to predict insurance costs based on demographic and health features, such as age, BMI, and smoking status. Using a Random Forest Regressor optimized with GridSearchCV, the model achieves accurate predictions, making it useful for estimating insurance premiums for individuals.
